		<p><span class="single1">I</span>'ve been a liar, been a thief, been a 
			<span class="mood1">lover, been a cheat</span></p>
		<p>All my sins need holy water, feel it 
			<span class="mood2">washing over me</span></p>
		<p>Well, 
			<span class="mood4">little one</span>, I don't want to admit to something, 
			<span class="mood5">if all it's gonna cause is pain</span></p>
		<p>Truth and my lies right now are 
			<span class="mood2">falling like the rain</span>, so let the 
			<span class="mood2">river run</span></p>

		<p>He's comin' home with his 
			<span class="mood4">neck scratched</span>, to catch flack</p>

		<p><span class="mood6">Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched</span></p>

		<p>On his breath's Jack, he's a 
			<span class="mood6">sex addict</span>, and she just wants to 
			<span class="mood1">exact revenge and get back</span></p>

		<p>It's a chess match, 
			<span class="mood6">she's on his back like a jet-pack</span></p>

		<p>She's kept track of all his 
			<span class="mood4">Internet chats</span>, and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next. Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks</p>

		<p>'Cause she loves danger, 
			<span class="mood7">psychopath</span>, and 
			<span class="mood6">you don't fuck with no man's girl</span>, 
			<span class="mood1">even I know that</span></p>

		<p>But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back, 
			<span class="mood4">knife in hand</span>, says their relationship's hangin' by a 

			<span class="mood4">strand</span></p>

		<p><span class="rot1">So she's been on the web lately</span></p>

		<p><span class="idek">Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man</span></p>

		<p><span class="rando">And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care</span></p>

		<p>Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said 
			<span class="mood5">"Bye Suzanne"</span></p>

		<p><span class="mood3">After the first night, but tonight <span class="single1">I am</span></p>
