			<p>The common names "sunflower" and "common sunflower" typically refer to the popular annual species Helianthus annuus, whose round flower heads in combination with the ligules look like the sun.</p>
		</div>	
		
		<div class="item2">
			<p>Several perennial Helianthus species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread rapidly and can become aggressive. The whorled sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus, was listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee.</p>
